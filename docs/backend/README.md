# Backend Docs

This folder contains backend architecture and planning docs migrated from the monorepo.

- `CONCURRENCY.md`: backend concurrency model and decision guide
- `AUDIO_ARCHITECTURE.md`: audio-serving architecture notes
- `PHASES_INDEX.md`: phased delivery plan with links to phase docs
- `phases/PHASE_*.md`: implementation plans, including phases that may still be pending

Note: several phase documents intentionally describe not-yet-implemented work. They are kept in this repo for roadmap continuity.
